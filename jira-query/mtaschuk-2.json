To demonstrate this approach, we asked a practical question: most sequencing studies set a target coverage depth, but how many lanes of sequencing will be required to achieve this for a given library?\r\n\r\nThe tumor-prediction model had 95.8% accuracy on independent validation data (Supplementary Table 6) and correctly identified from single-lane data all 18 cases in which sequencing six lanes of a library did not yield 50× coverage.\r\n\r\nIntriguingly, the fraction of votes was weakly correlated to cellularity (Spearman’s ρ = 0.36; P < 0.01; Supplementary Fig. 18), suggesting that low cellularity tumor samples tend to yield less usable sequence per lane. (Note from Morgan: hmm....)\r\n\r\nUsing one-eighth of a lane decreased performance only marginally. These data suggest that pooled, barcoded libraries can be used for routine quality prediction.\r\n\r\nin the ICGC project CPC-GENE, 24% of normal samples and 25% of tumors did not initially reach target depth and required ‘top-up’ sequencing.\"\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nhttps://labs.oicr.on.ca/Boutros-lab/software/SeqControl\r\n\r\n","priority":{"self":"https://jira.oicr.on.ca/rest/api/2/priority/3","iconUrl":"https://jira.oicr.on.ca/images/icons/priorities/major.png","name":"Major","id":"3"},"duedate":null,"customfield_10001":null,"issuelinks":[],"customfield_10004":null,"watches":{"self":"https://jira.oicr.on.ca/rest/api/2/issue/PDE-768/watchers","watchCount":1,"isWatching":true},"customfield_10000":null,"customfield_10102":null,"customfield_10601":"0|i001wn:","customfield_10600":"0|i001wn:","customfield_10101":null,"subtasks":[],"customfield_10100":null,"status":{"self":"https://jira.oicr.on.ca/rest/api/2/status/1","description":"The
